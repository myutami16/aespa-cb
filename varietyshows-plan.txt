   ### Episode 1: **"Welcome to MY Journey"** (Detailed Breakdown)

#### Concept:
This episode kicks off the series by placing aespa members in a digital escape room with themed puzzles inspired by their music, particularly *Next Level* and *Girls.* The escape room is designed as a multi-level digital world where each level reflects a past aespa concept or music video, and members must complete themed challenges to move forward.

#### Setting:
The escape room has a futuristic, tech-inspired design, with neon lights and holographic elements to mirror aespa’s signature cyber aesthetic. Each room or level represents a different “world” from aespa's past music concepts, such as the desert and space settings from *Next Level* or the high-tech battle scene from *Girls.*

#### Challenges Breakdown:

1. **Level 1 - "The Black Mamba Maze"**  
   - **Objective**: Navigate a neon-lit maze filled with obstacles that resemble the visual elements of the *Black Mamba* music video. 
   - **Challenge**: Each member is equipped with a tablet that reveals clues to find the exit. They must avoid “Black Mamba” traps (e.g., sensors that reset progress) and solve riddles related to aespa’s song lyrics or iconic scenes from the music video to unlock passages.
   - **Puzzle Example**: A riddle appears: “What is aespa’s AI counterpart called?” Answering "ae" unlocks the next clue.

2. **Level 2 - "Next Level Trivia"**  
   - **Objective**: Solve trivia questions and challenges based on *Next Level.* This level requires members to remember dance moves, iconic lyrics, and choreography.
   - **Challenge**: The room transforms into a digital dance floor with colored panels. Each panel has questions about *Next Level* or shows part of the dance moves, which members must replicate to score points. Only after scoring a certain number of points can they proceed.
   - **Puzzle Example**: The screen shows, “Complete the next lyric: ‘I’m on the Next Level…’” Members must complete the lyric correctly to unlock the door.

3. **Level 3 - "Girls Combat Training"**  
   - **Objective**: This level simulates a “battle” arena inspired by *Girls.* Members face a virtual “boss” (AI-generated) and must complete a series of physical and mental challenges.
   - **Challenge**: Members use VR headsets to enter a training scenario where they have to dodge obstacles, solve a memory-based puzzle involving images from their music videos, and hit targets that light up in a sequence. Each successfully completed task weakens the boss, and once defeated, the next door opens.
   - **Puzzle Example**: A sequence of images from different music videos flashes on a screen, and members must select them in the correct order of release.

4. **Final Level - "aespa Universe Riddle"**  
   - **Objective**: Unlock the final door by solving a complex riddle combining all their song concepts.
   - **Challenge**: The room’s wall displays a huge digital map connecting *Black Mamba,* *Next Level,* and *Girls* with symbols representing each concept (like snakes for *Black Mamba,* stars for *Next Level,* etc.). Members must work together to identify which symbol or word completes each part of the puzzle.
   - **Puzzle Example**: A message appears with missing words: “aespa travels through __ to find their __.” Members need to remember storyline details to answer accurately (e.g., “world” and “ae”). Once completed, the final door opens.

#### Ending Segment:
After escaping, the members enter a "Reflection Room" to discuss the experience. They talk about their favorite puzzles, funniest moments, and challenges. The episode concludes with each member leaving a message to fans about their journey and excitement for future episodes.

This setup combines teamwork, nostalgia, and excitement for fans, showcasing aespa’s past themes in a fun and engaging way!
